# Goal Tracking
The point of this app is a place for clients to be able to keep track of their goals. There is a basic shell of a React app provided, and the assignment is to complete the rest of the requirements in this file. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions what so ever, part of being a good developer is knowing when to reach out for help.

Please do not spend more than 4-6 hours on this project. This is meant to provide a code sample only that can be talked about during the in-person interview.

Also note that the UI is totally up to you.

## Requirements
1.  A new goal can be created with a title
1. All goals appear in a list of goals that shows the title of the goal and whether or not the goal has been completed
1. Clicking on a goal allows a client to edit the goal
1. Along with a title, goals can also have sub-tasks which can be marked as complete.
1. Subtasks contain only a title
1. The list of subtasks that belong to a goal can be edited when the goal is being edited
1. When all subtasks of a goal are marked as complete, the goal is marked as complete
1. No backend is required for this application, and it does not matter that all of the goals go away when the page is refreshed.
